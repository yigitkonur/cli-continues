# continues

> You hit the rate limit mid-debug. 30 messages of context — file changes, architecture decisions, half-finished refactors — and now you either wait hours or start fresh in another tool. **`continues` grabs your session from whichever AI coding tool you were using and hands it off to another one.** Conversation history, file changes, working state — all of it comes along.

```bash
npx continues
```

## Supported tools

14 AI coding agents, any-to-any handoff:

**Claude Code** · **Codex** · **GitHub Copilot CLI** · **Gemini CLI** · **Cursor** · **Amp** · **Cline** · **Roo Code** · **Kilo Code** · **Kiro** · **Crush** · **OpenCode** · **Factory Droid** · **Antigravity**

That's 182 cross-tool handoff paths. Pick any source, pick any destination — it works.

## Install

No install needed — just run `npx continues`. Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g continues    # gives you `continues` and `cont`
```

## How it works

1. **Discovery** — scans session directories for all 14 tools
2. **Parsing** — reads each tool's native format (JSONL, JSON, SQLite, YAML — they're all different)
3. **Extraction** — pulls recent messages, file changes, tool activity, AI reasoning
4. **Handoff** — generates a structured context doc and injects it into the target tool

The handoff document is designed so the receiving agent immediately understands what you were doing, what files were touched, what commands ran, and what's left to do.

## Usage

### Interactive (default)

Just run `continues`. It finds all your sessions, lets you pick one, and asks where to continue:

```
┌  continues — pick up where you left off
│
│  Found 1842 sessions across 14 CLI tools
│    claude: 723  codex: 72  cursor: 68  copilot: 39  ...
│
◆  Select a session
│  [claude]   2026-02-19 05:28  my-project    Debugging SSH tunnel config   84a36c5d
│  [copilot]  2026-02-19 04:41  my-project    Migrate presets from Electron c2f5974c
│  [codex]    2026-02-18 23:12  my-project    Fix OpenCode SQLite parser    a1e90b3f
│  ...
└

◆  Continue in:
│  ○ Gemini   ○ Codex   ○ Amp   ○ Kiro   ...
└
```

When you run from a project directory, sessions from that directory are prioritized.

### Quick resume

Skip the picker entirely — resume the Nth most recent session from a tool:

```bash
continues claude        # latest Claude session
continues codex 3       # 3rd most recent Codex
continues amp           # latest Amp
continues cline         # latest Cline
continues kiro          # latest Kiro
continues crush         # latest Crush
```

Works for all 14 tools. This uses **native resume** — same tool, full history, no context injection.

### Cross-tool handoff

This is the main thing. Start in one tool, finish in another:

```bash
# Hit the Claude rate limit? Hand it off to Gemini:
continues resume abc123 --in gemini

# Or pass flags through to the destination tool:
continues resume abc123 --in codex --yolo --search --add-dir /tmp
```

`continues` maps common flags (model, sandbox, auto-approve, extra dirs) to the target tool's equivalent. Anything it doesn't recognize gets passed through as-is.

### Scripting & CI

```bash
continues list                          # table output
continues list --source claude --json   # JSON, filtered
continues list --jsonl -n 10            # JSONL, last 10
continues scan                          # discovery stats
continues scan --rebuild                # force re-index
```

### Inspect (for debugging)

See exactly what gets parsed and what ends up in the handoff:

```bash
continues inspect abc123                              # diagnostic view
continues inspect abc123 --preset full --write-md handoff.md   # dump full markdown
continues inspect abc123 --truncate 50                # compact one-liner view
```

### Dump (bulk export)

Export all sessions to files for backup, analysis, or archival:

```bash
# Export all sessions to markdown (default)
continues dump all ./sessions

# Export specific tool's sessions
continues dump claude ./sessions/claude
continues dump gemini ./sessions/gemini

# Export as JSON instead of markdown
continues dump all ./sessions --json

# Control verbosity with presets
continues dump all ./sessions --preset full

# Limit number of sessions
continues dump all ./sessions --limit 50
```

File naming: `{source}_{id}.md` or `{source}_{id}.json`

## Verbosity control

Not every handoff needs to be a novel. Four presets control how much detail goes in:

| Preset | Messages | Tool samples | Subagent detail | When to use |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------|:----------------|:------------|
| `minimal` | 3 | 0 | None | Quick context, token-constrained targets |
| `standard` | 10 | 5 | 500 chars | Default — good balance |
| `verbose` | 20 | 10 | 2000 chars | Debugging, complex multi-file tasks |
| `full` | 50 | All | Everything | Complete session capture |

```bash
continues resume abc123 --preset full
```

### YAML config

For per-project defaults, drop a `.continues.yml` in your project root:

```yaml
preset: verbose
recentMessages: 15
shell:
  maxSamples: 10
  stdoutLines: 20
```

Resolution order: `--config <path>` → `.continues.yml` in cwd → `~/.continues/config.yml` → `standard` preset. See `.continues.example.yml` for the full reference.

## What gets extracted

Every tool stores sessions differently — different formats, different schemas, different paths. Here's what `continues` reads:

| Tool | Format | Where it lives |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------|
| Claude Code | JSONL | `~/.claude/projects/` |
| Codex | JSONL | `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| Copilot | YAML + JSONL | `~/.copilot/session-state/` |
| Gemini CLI | JSON | `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/` |
| OpenCode | SQLite | `~/.local/share/opencode/storage/` |
| Factory Droid | JSONL + JSON | `~/.factory/sessions/` |
| Cursor | JSONL | `~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/` |
| Amp | JSON | `~/.local/share/amp/threads/` |
| Kiro | JSON | `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/workspace-sessions/` |
| Crush | SQLite | `~/.crush/crush.db` |
| Cline | JSON | VS Code `globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/tasks/` |
| Roo Code | JSON | VS Code `globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/tasks/` |
| Kilo Code | JSON | VS Code `globalStorage/kilocode.kilo-code/tasks/` |
| Antigravity | JSONL | `~/.gemini/antigravity/code_tracker/` |

All reads are **read-only** — `continues` never modifies your session files. Index cached at `~/.continues/sessions.jsonl` (5-min TTL, auto-refresh).

### Tool activity in handoffs

The handoff document includes a **Tool Activity** section so the target agent knows what was *done*, not just what was *said*:

```markdown
## Tool Activity
- **Bash** (×47): `$ npm test → exit 0` · `$ git status → exit 0` · `$ npm run build → exit 1`
- **Edit** (×12): `edit src/auth.ts` · `edit src/api/routes.ts` · `edit tests/auth.test.ts`
- **Grep** (×8): `grep "handleLogin" src/` · `grep "JWT_SECRET"` · `grep "middleware"`

## Session Notes
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4
- **Tokens**: 45,230 in / 12,847 out
- 💭 Need to handle the edge case where token refresh races with logout
```

This works for all 14 tools — bash commands, file reads/writes/edits, grep/glob, MCP tool calls, thinking blocks, subagent dispatches, token usage, model info. The shared `SummaryCollector` keeps the format consistent regardless of source.

## Commands reference

| Command | What it does |
|:--------|:-------------|
| `continues` | Interactive TUI picker |
| `continues list` | List sessions (`--source`, `--json`, `--jsonl`, `-n`) |

Global flags: `--config <path>`, `--preset <name>`, `--verbose`, `--debug`

## Community contributions

This started as a 7-tool project and grew fast thanks to contributors:

- **Factory Droid support** — [#1](https://github.com/yigitkonur/cli-continues/pull/1), first community parser
- **Cursor AI support** — [#4](https://github.com/yigitkonur/cli-continues/pull/4) by [@Evrim267](https://github.com/Evrim267), with smart slug-to-path resolution
- **Single-tool error handling** — [#3](https://github.com/yigitkonur/cli-continues/pull/3) by [@barisgirismen](https://github.com/barisgirismen), clear error when only one CLI is installed
- **Env var overrides** — [#14](https://github.com/yigitkonur/cli-continues/pull/14) by [@yutakobayashidev](https://github.com/yutakobayashidev), respects `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`

The latest batch — **Amp, Kiro, Crush, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code, and Antigravity** — was added by reverse-engineering [mnemo](https://github.com/Pilan-AI/mnemo)'s Go adapters and adapting the schemas for TypeScript. Along the way we also improved token/cache/model extraction for the existing Claude, Codex, Cursor, and Gemini parsers.

**Bugs fixed in this round:**
- Symlink traversal — `fs.Dirent.isDirectory()` returns `false` for symlinks; fixed with `isSymbolicLink() && statSync()` fallback
- Zero-token display — no longer shows "0 in / 0 out" when a session has no token data
- Key Decisions count — now respects the verbosity config instead of being hardcoded to 5

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22+** (uses built-in `node:sqlite` for OpenCode and Crush)
- At least one of the 14 supported tools installed
- `sqlite3` CLI binary (only needed for Crush — ships with macOS)

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yigitkonur/cli-continues
cd cli-continues
pnpm install

pnpm run dev          # run with tsx, no build needed
pnpm run build        # compile TypeScript
pnpm test             # run tests
pnpm run test:watch   # watch mode
```

Adding a new tool? Create a parser in `src/parsers/`, add the tool name to `src/types/tool-names.ts`, register it in `src/parsers/registry.ts`. The registry has a compile-time completeness check — if you add a name but forget the parser, it throws at import.
